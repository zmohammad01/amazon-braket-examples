    "Variational quantum algorithms, a specific form of hybrid algorithms, work in the very same way, using parametrized quantum circuits rather than parametrized neural networks and replacing the GPU with a QPU. \n",
    "Here, you start with an initial guess for the parameters that define your circuit, have the QPU execute that circuit, perform measurements to calculate an objective function, pass this value (together with the current values of the parameters) back to the CPU and have this *classical* CPU update the parameters based on that information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, coordinating that workflow for quantum computers is much more challenging than in the previous case. Quantum computers are located in specialized laboratory facilities, are typically single threaded, and have special latency requirements. \n",
    "This is exactly the undifferentiated heavy-lifting that Amazon Braket takes away for you such that we can focus on our scientific problem. \n",
    "For the sake of this introductory tutorial, we simply use a classical circuit simulator (that mimic the behaviour of a quantum machine) as device to execute our quantum circuits.\n",

    "While VQE is a very general approach, for concreteness we will focus on applying VQE to the one-dimensional Transverse Ising Model (TIM). The TIM belongs to a the broader class of many-body spin systems that are inherently hard to study on classical computers as the dimension of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of particles in the system. With the help of a quantum computer, however, we can study these many-body systems with less overhead as the number of qubits required only grows polynomially. Even more so, the specific TIM is an integrable system and can be solved exactly, as shown in [7]. We will use these exact results as a benchmark for our approximate VQE results. \n",

    "The transverse field Ising model is a quantum version of the classical Ising model that describes a lattice of spins with nearest neighbour interactions of strength $J$ (as set by the alignment or anti-alignment of spin projections along the $z$ axis), as well as an external magnetic field along the $x$ axis with strength $B$, creating an energetic bias for one x-axis spin direction over the other. \n",

    "In other words, to *approximate* the ground state we are looking for, VQE can only operate within the bounds of the general ansatz we are using (the so-called ansatz space), by having a quantum computer prepare this very ansatz state with a parameterized gate sequence, and then have a classical optimizer iteratively update the optimal parameters. \n",

    "__VQE ansatz for TIM__: Next, we need to choose an ansatz appropriate for the system under study, the Transverse Ising Model (TIM). \n",
    "We use an ansatz that can account for quantum entanglement. \n",
    "Because of the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry discussed above, for any given state $\\left|\\Psi(\\theta)\\right>$ the rotated state $R_{x}\\left|\\Psi(\\theta)\\right>$ is a degenerate state with the same energy. \n",
    "Therefore, we take our ansatz as a linear superposition of these two degenerate states, $\\left|\\psi(\\theta)\\right> = \\alpha \\left|\\Psi(\\theta)\\right> + \\beta R_{x}\\left|\\Psi(\\theta)\\right>$. How can we prepare such a state on a quantum computer? We use the following sequence of parametrized gates [10]: \n",
    "\n",
    "First, starting from $\\left|0000\\right>$ we apply a general single qubit rotation to the first qubit to obtain the state \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|000\\dots\\right> \\rightarrow \\alpha \\left|000\\dots\\right> + \\beta \\left|100\\dots\\right>,$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where the parameters $\\alpha, \\beta$ can be learned in the training process. \n",
    "Then, we apply a sequence of CNOT gates as is done for the preparation of GHZ states. \n",
    "The first CNOT between the first and second qubits prepares the state \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha \\left|000\\dots\\right> + \\beta \\left|110\\dots\\right>.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue with CNOT gates till we arrive at the parametrized ansatz\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha \\left|000\\dots\\right> + \\beta \\left|111\\dots\\right>.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to account for different polarization directions we apply parametrized single qubit rotations around the $y$ axis to arrive at our VQE trial ansatz state \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|\\Psi(\\theta)\\right> = \\alpha U_{y}(\\theta_{y})\\left|000\\dots\\right> + \\beta U_{y}(\\theta_{y})\\left|111\\dots\\right>,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $U_{y}(\\theta_{y})=\\prod \\exp(-i \\theta_{y}/2 \\sigma_{i}^{y})$."

    "__Illustration__: Below, we illustrate our ansatz (as prepared by our method ```circuit```) with a circuit diagram for a small number of qubits $N$ and a fixed set of classical parameters. We print both our VQE ansatz as well as the modified circuit with a layer of single-qubit Hadamard gates ```H``` attached at the end, as needed to measure the $x$ projection with $\\sigma_{i}^{x}$ for all qubits. The latter is needed to compute the expectation value for the transverse field term $H_{B}=(B/2)\\sum_{i}\\sigma_{i}^{x}$. With this simple visualization we can convince ourselves that we have implemented the circuit ansatz as desired.  "

    "We are now ready to run some VQE simulation experiments. First of all, you can play and experiment yourself with the number of qubits $N$. Secondly, you may also experiment with the classical optimizer. Since we are using an off-the-shelf ```scipy``` minimizer (as described in more detail [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html)), you can simply swap between different optimizers by setting the ```method``` parameter accordingly, as done above in the line ```result = minimize(..., method='SLSQP')```. Some popular options readily available within this library include *Nelder-Mead*, *BFGS* and *COBYLA*.    \n",
    "As a precautionary warning, note that the classical optimization step may get stuck in a local optimum, rather than finding the global minimum for our parametrized VQE ansatz wavefunction. \n",
    "To address this issue, we run several optimization loops, starting from different random parameter seeds. \n",
    "You can set the number of these optimization loops using the ```n_initial``` parameter, as shown below. \n",
    "While this brute-force approach does not provide any guarantee to find the global optimum, from a pragmatic point of view at least it does increase the odds of finding an acceptable solution, at the expense of potentially having to run many more circuits on the QPU.\n",
    "For a more detailed and sophisticated discussion of classical optimization of VQE we refer to Ref.[11]. "

    "As detailed in the seminal paper by [7], the paradigmatic TIM can be solved with the help of a (highly non-local) Jordan-Wigner transformation that expresses the spin (qubit) variables as fermionic variables, and leading to a sum of local quadratic terms containing fermionic creation and annihilation operators. \n",
    "The resulting Hamiltonian is mathematically identical to that of a superconductor in the mean field Bogoliubov deGennes formalism and can be completely understood in the same standard way. \n",
    "Specifically, the exact excitation spectrum and eigenvalues can be determined by Fourier transforming into momentum space and diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we just use the known results from Ref.[7] to recover the exact ground-state energy with the helper function defined below, and refer the interested reader to the broad set of literature on the TIM for further details. The original paper is available [online here](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~bxn/pfeuty1970.pdf). "
