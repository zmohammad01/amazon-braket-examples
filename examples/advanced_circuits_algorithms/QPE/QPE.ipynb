    "__Introduction__: A unitary matrix is a complex, square matrix whose adjoint (or conjugate transpose) is equal to its inverse. Unitary matrices have many nice properties, including the fact that their eigenvalues are always roots of unity (that is, phases). Given a unitary matrix $U$ (satisfying $U^{\\dagger}U=\\mathbb{1}=UU^{\\dagger}$) and an eigenstate $|\\psi \\rangle$ with $U|\\psi \\rangle = e^{2\\pi i\\varphi}|\\psi \\rangle$, the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm provides an estimate $\\tilde{\\varphi} \\approx \\varphi$ for the phase $\\varphi$ (with $\\varphi \\in [0,1]$ since the eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\exp(2\\pi i\\varphi)$ of a unitary have modulus one). \n",
    "The QPE works with high probability within an additive error $\\varepsilon$ using $O(\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$ qubits (without counting the qubits used to encode the eigenstate) and $O(1/\\varepsilon)$ controlled-$U$ operations [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "__Quantum Phase Estimation Algorithm__: \n",
    "The QPE algorithm takes a unitary $U$ as input. For the sake of simplicity (we will generalize the discussion below), suppose that the algorithm also takes as input an eigenstate $|\\psi \\rangle$ fulfilling \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U|\\psi \\rangle = \\lambda |\\psi \\rangle,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\lambda = \\exp(2\\pi i\\varphi)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "QPE uses two registers of qubits: we refer to the first register as *precision* qubits (as the number of qubits $n$ in the first register sets the achievable precision of our results) and the second register as *query* qubits (as the second register hosts the eigenstate $|\\psi \\rangle$). \n",
    "Suppose we have prepared this second register in $|\\psi \\rangle$.  We then prepare a uniform superposition of all basis vectors in the first register using a series of Hadamard gates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we apply a series of controlled-unitaries $C-U^{2^{k}}$ for different powers of $k=0,1,\\dots, n-1$ (as illustrated in the circuit diagram that follows). \n",
    "For example, for $k=1$ we get\n",

    "The QPE algorithm implements a series of these transformations for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n-1$, using $n$ qubits in the precision register. \n",

    "3. We run QPE with $U=X$ and prepare $|\\Psi\\rangle = |1\\rangle = X|0\\rangle$ which is *not* an eigenstate of $U$. \n",
    "Because $|1\\rangle = (|+\\rangle - |-\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$, we expect to measure both $\\varphi=0$ and $\\varphi=0.5$ associated with the two eigenstates $|\\pm\\rangle$. \n",
