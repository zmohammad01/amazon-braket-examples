    "__Introduction__: The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a quantum algorithm for applying the discrete Fourier transform to the amplitudes of a quantum state.  The QFT is therefore a quantum analog of the classical discrete Fourier transform [1, 2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first review the classical discrete Fourier transform (DFT). \n",
    "Given a vector $(x_0,\\ldots,x_{N-1})\\in\\mathbb{C}^N$, the discrete Fourier transform computes the vector $(y_0,\\ldots,y_{N-1})$ for which\n",
    "$$ y_j = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} x_k e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{N}jk}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "__Quantum Fourier Transformation__: In close analogy to the classical Fourier transform, the QFT takes an arbitrary input state $\\left|\\mathrm{input}\\right> = \\sum x_{j}\\left|j\\right>$ (with the orthonormal basis states $\\left|0\\right>$, $\\left|1\\right>$, ..., $\\left|N-1\\right>$), and maps it to the output state\n",
    "$$\\left|\\mathrm{output}\\right> = \\sum_{k} y_{k}\\left|k\\right>,$$ \n",
    "with coefficients\n",
    "$$y_{k}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{n}x_{n}e^{2\\pi i\\cdot n\\cdot k/N}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "__Binary representation (notation)__: We take $N=2^{n}$, with $n$ being the number of qubits. In the binary representation, the states $\\{\\left|x\\right>\\}$ read explicitly \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|x\\right> = \\left|x_{1}x_{2}\\dots x_{n}\\right>,$$ \n",
    "where\n",
    "$$x = x_{1}2^{n-1}+x_{2}2^{n-2}+\\dots+x_{n}2^{0}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a four-qubit system $\\left|7\\right> = \\left|0111\\right>$ and $\\left|8\\right> = \\left|1000\\right>$.\n",
    "Similarly, we use the following notation to represent binary fractions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$[0.x_{l}x_{l+1}\\dots x_{m}] = \\frac{x_{l}}{2^{1}} + \\frac{x_{l+1}}{2^{2}} + \\frac{x_{m}}{2^{m-l+1}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "__Product representation of QFT__: Very often, the product representation of the QFT proves useful. Accordingly, the QFT can be expressed (up to normalization) as\n",
    "$$\\left|x_{1}x_{2}\\dots x_{n}\\right> \\longrightarrow \\frac{(\\left|0\\right>+e^{2\\pi i[0.x_{n}]}\\left|1\\right>)\\otimes (\\left|0\\right>+e^{2\\pi i[0.x_{n-1}x_{n}]}\\left|1\\right>)\\otimes \\dots \\otimes (\\left|0\\right>+e^{2\\pi i[0.x_{1}x_{2}\\dots x_{n}]}\\left|1\\right>)}{2^{n/2}}.$$\n",
    "For example, the QFT on three qubits can be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{QFT}\\left|x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}\\right> = \\frac{1}{2^{3/2}}\\left(\\left|0\\right>+e^{2\\pi i[0.x_{3}]}\\left|1\\right>\\right) \\otimes \\left(\\left|0\\right>+e^{2\\pi i[0.x_{2}x_{3}]}\\left|1\\right>\\right) \\otimes \\left(\\left|0\\right>+e^{2\\pi i[0.x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}]}\\left|1\\right>\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for the simple input state $\\left|0,0,0\\right>$ with $x_{i}=0$, it is easy to see that the QFT produces a uniform superposition of all computational basis vectors (since only the Hadamard gates act non-trivially in this case).  Explicitly:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "__Inverse QFT__: Below we will also implement the inverse QFT algorithm (denoted by $\\mathrm{QFT}^{\\dagger}$, or sometimes $\\mathrm{QFT}^{-1}$), which fulfills $\\mathrm{QFT}\\cdot\\mathrm{QFT}^{\\dagger}=\\mathbb{1}$, where $\\mathbb{1}$ is the identity. For example, with the inverse QFT we can invert the above three qubit QFT as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{QFT}^\\dagger\\mathrm{QFT}\\left|x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}\\right> = \\mathrm{QFT}^{\\dagger}(\\left|0\\right>+e^{2\\pi i[0.x_{3}]}\\left|1\\right>) \\otimes (\\left|0\\right>+e^{2\\pi i[0.x_{2}x_{3}]}\\left|1\\right>) \\otimes (\\left|0\\right>+e^{2\\pi i[0.x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}]}\\left|1\\right>)/2^{3/2}=\\left|x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}\\right>.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example for inverse QFT:__ For further illustration, we will run a concrete example of this kind below. \n",
    "Specifically, consider the following example with $x_{1}=0$, $x_{2}=1$, and $x_{3}=0$ encoding the number 2 in binary representation. \n",
    "Accordingly, we prepare the initial state (up to normalization)\n",

    "\n",
    "This state can be prepared using the single-qubits gates $H$ and $R_{z}$ as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|\\Psi_\\mathrm{in}\\right>=H\\left|0\\right> \\otimes R_{z}(\\pi)H\\left|0\\right> \\otimes R_{z}(\\pi/2)H\\left|0\\right>.$$\n",
    "\n",
